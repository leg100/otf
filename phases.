a run has many states
a run has many phases
a phase has many states

run state is sortable: RunPending is first; final states are last

a run state *may* have a corresponding phase state, i.e. RunPending does not, whereas RunPlanQueued has JobPending. Note: this is the state that is *set* when the run state is set.

a run has an id
a phase has an id

a run state has actions it either supports or doesn't, e.g. startable, cancelable
calling an action on a run state it that it doesn't support results in an error

a run state is either a final state or non-final state

on successful completion of a phase a report is produced, e.g. planned or applied changes
