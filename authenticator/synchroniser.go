// * for each cloud team:
//   - if owners then create corresponding organization if it doesn't already
//     exist as well as owners team and make them an owner.
//   - if a non-owners team then the organization is expected to already exist
//     and if so then team is created if it doesn't already exist, and they are
//     made a member.
//
// * for each otf team the user is a member of but for which there is no
// corresponding cloud team:
//   - if owners then as long as there is at least one other owner then they are
//     removed from the owners team in otf; if they are the last owner then the
//     membership is not removed (every otf organization must have at least one
//     owner).
//   - if non-owners then they are removed from the team.
//
// * a personal organization is created matching username if it doesn't already
// exist, along with an owners team of which they are made a member.
