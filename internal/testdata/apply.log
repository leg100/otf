Running apply in the remote backend. Output will stream here. Pressing Ctrl-C
will cancel the remote apply if it's still pending. If the apply started it
will stop streaming the logs, but will not stop the apply running remotely.

Preparing the remote apply...

The remote workspace is configured to work with configuration at
cloud relative to the target repository.

Terraform will upload the contents of the following directory,
excluding files or directories as defined by a .terraformignore file
at /home/louis/co/etok-example/.terraformignore (if it is present),
in order to capture the filesystem context the remote workspace expects:
    /home/louis/co/etok-example

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.example will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "example" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

  # null_resource.example2 will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "example2" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

  # module.random.random_id.test will be created
  + resource "random_id" "test" {
      + b64_std     = (known after apply)
      + b64_url     = (known after apply)
      + byte_length = 2
      + dec         = (known after apply)
      + hex         = (known after apply)
      + id          = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
