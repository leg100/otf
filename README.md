## Quickstart Demo

To quickly try out otf you can sign into the demo server using your github account:

https://demo.otf.ninja

Once signed in you'll notice any github organization and team memberships are synchronised across automatically. Additionally, an organization matching your username is created.

Now we'll login to the account in your terminal. You'll need terraform installed.

NOTE: only terraform version 1.2.0 and later is supported.

Setup local credentials:

```bash
terraform login demo.otf.ninja
```

Confirm with `yes` to proceed and you'll be asked to give consent to allow `terraform` to access your account on OTF. After you give consent, you should be notified that you can close the browser and return to the terminal.

In the terminal `terraform login` should have printed out confirmation of success:

```
Success! Terraform has obtained and saved an API token.
```

Write some terraform configuration to a file, setting the organization to your username:

```terraform
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname     = "demo.otf.ninja"
    organization = "<your username>"

    workspaces {
      name = "dev"
    }
  }
}

resource "null_resource" "demo" {}
```

Initialize terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

> NOTE: if you're using Mac or Windows, you may receive an error similar to the following error:
>
> > Error: Failed to install provider
> >
> > Error while installing hashicorp/null v3.2.1: the current package for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null 3.2.1
> > doesn't match any of the checksums previously recorded in the dependency lock file; for more information:
> > https://www.terraform.io/language/provider-checksum-verification
>
> If so, you need to update your lockfile (`.terraform.lock.hcl`) to include hashes for the platform that the OTF demo is hosted on (linux):
>
> ```
> terraform providers lock -platform=linux_amd64
> ```
>
> Then re-run `terraform init`

Now create a plan:

```bash
terraform plan
```

After you've invoked `terraform plan`, you'll see the plan output along with a link. Click on the link to the run to view the status and logs:

You can optionally run `terraform apply` to apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You've reached the end of this quickstart demo. See the [docs](https://docs.otf.ninja) for instructions on deploying OTF.
