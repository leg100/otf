# Introduction

OTF is an open-source alternative to Terraform Enterprise, sharing many of its features:

* Full Terraform CLI integration
* Remote execution mode: plans and applies run on servers
* Agent execution mode: plans and applies run on agents
* Remote state backend: state stored in PostgreSQL
* SSO: sign in using an identity provider, e.g. Github, Gitlab etc.
* Module registry (provider registry coming soon)
* RBAC: control team access to workspaces
* VCS integration: trigger runs and publish modules from git commits
* Compatible with much of the Terraform Enterprise/Cloud API
* Minimal dependencies: requires only PostgreSQL
* Stateless: horizontally scale servers in pods on Kubernetes, etc

Feel free to trial it using the demo deployment: [https://demo.otf.ninja](https://demo.otf.ninja)

### OIDC

!!! note
    OIDC functions differently from the other authentication providers. It does noes create organizations, or teams as the gitlab, and github authentication providers do.

You can configure OTF to sign users in using [OpenID-Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC). The OIDC authentication provider uses an upstream identity provider(idp) such as [Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc), [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect), or [Dex](https://dexidp.io/).

Create an Application for OTF in your preferred idp.

* Set the name to something appropriate, e.g. `otf`
* Add the following `redirect uri` to the application:

    `https://<otfd_install_hostname>/oauth/<oidc_name>/callback`

Once you've created the application note the client id and secret.

Set the following flags when running otfd: 

* `--oidc-name=<oidc_name>` which is the user-friendly name of the idp. This can be something like `azure-sso`, or `google`.
* `--oidc-issuer-url=<issuer-url>` which is the URL of the idp's oidc configuration. This varies depending on the identity provider used.
* `--oidc-redirect-url=<redirect-uri>` which is the otf url that is invoked by the idp after the authentication process. This should match the redirect uri that was added to the idp's application earlier.
* `--oidc-client-id=<client-id>` which is the `client-id` generated by the idp when we created the application. 
* `--oidc-client-secret=<client-secret>` which is the `client-secret` generated by the idp when we created the application.
