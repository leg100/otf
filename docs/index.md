* Agent execution mode: plans and applies run on agents
* Remote state backend: state stored in PostgreSQL
* SSO: sign in using an identity provider, e.g. Github, Gitlab etc.
* Module registry (provider registry coming soon)
* RBAC: control team access to workspaces
* VCS integration: trigger runs and publish modules from git commits
* Compatible with much of the Terraform Enterprise/Cloud API
* Minimal dependencies: requires only PostgreSQL
* Stateless: horizontally scale servers in pods on Kubernetes, etc
