Running plan in the remote backend. Output will stream here. Pressing Ctrl-C
will stop streaming the logs, but will not stop the plan running remotely.

Preparing the remote plan...

The remote workspace is configured to work with configuration at
cloud relative to the target repository.

Terraform will upload the contents of the following directory,
excluding files or directories as defined by a .terraformignore file
at /home/louis/co/etok-example/.terraformignore (if it is present),
in order to capture the filesystem context the remote workspace expects:
    /home/louis/co/etok-example

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.example will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "example" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

  # null_resource.example2 will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "example2" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

  # module.random.random_id.test will be created
  + resource "random_id" "test" {
      + b64_std     = (known after apply)
      + b64_url     = (known after apply)
      + byte_length = 2
      + dec         = (known after apply)
      + hex         = (known after apply)
      + id          = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
